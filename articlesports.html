        Matt Fagerson will earn his 50th cap in Scotland's final Autumn Nations Series match against Australia, with Jamie Ritchie also starting in the back row.
        
        Ritchie is the only change in the forward pack from the defeat by South Africa two weeks ago, with the Edinburgh flanker starting at blindside and Fagerson shifting to number eight in place of the injured Jack Dempsey.
        
        Having made his comeback from concussion against Portugal last week, Darcy Graham plays on the wing with Blair Kinghorn returning to his more natural full-back berth.
        
        That means Glasgow's Tom Jordan drops to the bench, having impressed at 15 on his first three caps.
        
        Scotland are aiming to deny Australia a first 'grand slam' tour of the home nations since 1984, with the rejuvenated Wallabies having beaten England and Wales so far and with their final Test against Ireland to come next weekend.
        
        Gregor Townsend's side comfortably defeated Fiji and Portugal either side of a 32-15 loss to the world champion Springboks.
        
        Tight-head prop Will Hurd, second row Alex Craig, and scrum-half George Horne are among the replacements having been part of the second-string side which swept aside the Portuguese 59-21 a week ago.
        
        "[If we win] it will give us a massive boost going into the Six Nations because we're playing a quality side," Townsend said.
        
        "It'll be frustrating if we don't deliver a performance that we've been working towards. If we don't at least match that performance of South Africa - that's what we're building towards."</p>
